# What is Spyglass

Spyglass is a Clojure client for Memcached built on top of [SpyMemcached](http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/)


## This is a Work In Progress

Spyglass is *very* young and incomplete. Nothing to see here yet, move along.


## Development

Spyglass uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against
all supported Clojure versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit
a pull request on Github.
